# SESSION_RESUME — Tier B Group 1 (Security ✅ + Money/Data Phase 1·1b·3 ✅)

> Security batch + CSRF enforcement shipped. Money + Data Integrity batch: migrations **029/030/031 done** (CHECK constraints + FK integrity + GDPR deletion rework). Phase 2 (B14/B35) is the remaining code-side work. See "Money + Data Integrity batch" below.

## Status

**Phase:** TIER B — Group 1, Part 1: **Security Batch — COMPLETE + CSRF ENFORCED ON PROD.**
**Branch:** `main`. Security-batch (6 commits) + `fix/middleware-edge-split` (middleware-was-dead fix: moved to `src/middleware.ts`, Edge-safe auth/csrf split) both merged & pushed.
**Enforcement:** B1 CSRF is **LIVE/enforcing** in production — `CSRF_ENFORCE=true`, Production-scoped, durability-verified (403 survives a fresh redeploy). The toggle remains as a kill-switch (unset/Instant-Rollback → log-only).

## What shipped (6 commits)

| Commit | Item | Summary | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `62b8592` | B6+B7 | Fail-closed encryption key (no dev fallback) + mandatory 2FA `loginNonce` (verify route 401 + middleware fail-closed) | tsc ✓ · encrypt round-trip ✓ |
| `5366565` | B4 | `diag-openai`/`diag-resend` gated on `ADMIN_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` (404 before auth, mirrors `test-db`) | tsc ✓ · live 404/401 both ways ✓ |
| `acd3773` | B8 | Exact migration allowlist Set (replaces `startsWith` wildcard) — 26 routes 002–024,026–028 | tsc ✓ · enumerated from disk |
| `275c570` | B2+B3 | Server-signed OAuth state (`src/lib/oauthState.ts`, HMAC AUTH_SECRET, 10-min expiry) + `returnTo` open-redirect guard; new `/api/consumer/social/oauth-url`; settings page fetches signed URL | tsc ✓ · 14/14 unit tests ✓ |
| `1319259` | B1 | Middleware CSRF enforcement (Edge-safe comparator, Option 2 behavioral rule) **log-only default** + global `CsrfFetchProvider` interceptor; `CSRF_ENFORCE` toggle | tsc ✓ |
| `41794b8` | B9 | Playwright CSRF meta-tag/cookie test; `playwright.config.ts` honors `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` for remote runs | tsc ✓ |

**B5 deferred** (16-byte AES-GCM IV). Accepted deviation — backward-compat trap (would break all existing ciphertext). Revisit at next key-rotation pass.

## B1 design notes (for whoever flips enforcement)

- **Encoding = Option 2 (behavioral rule):** middleware `requiresCsrf()` enforces on mutating `/api/*` EXCEPT 6 exempt prefixes (`/api/auth/ /api/webhooks/ /api/cron/ /api/jobs/ /api/pusher/ /api/csrf/`) AND auto-skips any request carrying `Authorization: Bearer` / `x-admin-api-key` / `x-api-key` (token-authed = no cookie-CSRF surface). Self-maintaining for future migrations.
- **Allowlist audit:** 196 mutating routes · 50 already-CSRF · 146 missing → 52 exempt (Category A, all token/secret/unauth), 94 cookie-authed get enforced. `authenticateAdmin` verified Bearer/x-api-key only; `social/cron` verified CRON_SECRET.
- **Breakage fix:** 104 raw `fetch()` mutations across 52 files, none attached the token. Instead of editing all, `CsrfFetchProvider` (mounted in root `layout.tsx`) patches `window.fetch` to attach `x-csrf-token` on same-origin mutating `/api` non-exempt requests (skips externals/GETs/exempt; `ensureCsrfCookie` first; won't clobber apiPost). Covers all 104.
- **Edge-safe comparator:** `csrf.ts` validator uses node:crypto (would crash Edge middleware) → middleware uses a pure-JS constant-time compare `validateCsrfEdge`.

## Rollout status — DONE ✅

All steps complete and verified on prod:
1. ✅ Security batch + `fix/middleware-edge-split` merged to `main`, deployed.
2. ✅ Middleware confirmed *running* on Vercel (`x-mw-ran: 1`, `[MW]` logs) — it was dead before (wrong location).
3. ✅ Log-only prod smoke: only gap found was `POST /api/analytics/track` (sendBeacon telemetry) → exempted (`c97dde5`). All authed mutations (vote, feedback, notification, profile, consent, redeem, community post, full payment lifecycle) clean.
4. ✅ Enforcement flipped: `CSRF_ENFORCE=true` (Production, durability-verified). Negative curl → `403 csrf-403`; positive curl → `continue`; real browser vote works; B9 Playwright 2/2 passed; watch window clean.

**Kill-switch / rollback:** fastest is Vercel **Instant Rollback** to the prior log-only deployment (alias re-point, near-instant). Otherwise unset `CSRF_ENFORCE` + redeploy (→ log-only), or `git revert`. No schema/data changes anywhere in the batch — reverts are clean.

**Payment-path coverage (code-verified, not just smoke-tested):** create-order, verify/capture (`RazorpayCheckout.tsx`), release, refund all use `apiPost` → token attached natively. The Razorpay webhook (`/api/webhooks/razorpay`, exempt) remains the capture source-of-truth.

## Verification constraint (carry forward)

Local `npm run dev` has pathological compile times (142–208s) → middleware HTTP tests are unreliable locally (requests hit before middleware compiles; no `x-mw-ran`, NextAuth default redirect, `[CSRF_META_EMPTY]`). **Verify on Vercel, not local.** Static checks (tsc, code review, `tsx` unit scripts) preferred locally. Dev log from PowerShell redirect is UTF-16 — decode with `tr -d '\000'`.

## Money + Data Integrity batch — status

| Phase | Migration | What | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 029 | money≥0 CHECKs (campaign_payments amounts, reward_redemptions.points_spent, rewards.points_cost) + B18 proposed_rate range (0..₹10L = 100,000,000 paise cap) + campaign_applications.status enum | ✅ landed + verified |
| 1b | 030 | status/enum CHECKs (campaign_payments.status + payment_type, reward_redemptions.status) | ✅ landed + verified |
| 3 | 031 | **FK integrity + GDPR deletion rework (B33)** | ✅ landed + verified |
| 2 | — | B14 redemption rounding + B35 refund→campaign_payments (code-side) | ⏭ not started |

**B19 dropped** — audit showed 0 orphan reviewers + `fk_influencer_reviews_reviewer` already exists.
**Deferred backlog:** `payment_redemptions` status CHECK (separate table from reward_redemptions; its own value set incl. `completed`).
**Commits:** `43d1169` (029) · `19ce890` (030) · `ad1d2d9` (031 + cron rewrite) · `ee62a36` (rule_id type fix).

### Phase 3 (migration 031) — what it did
- Added the audit-confirmed missing FKs with GDPR on-delete policy. Final `confdeltype` across all `fk_%`: **CASCADE=104, SET NULL=38, RESTRICT=7** (RESTRICT=7 is exactly the designed set: `reward_redemptions.reward_id` + the 6 product-content `product_id` FKs).
- Policy: **CASCADE** = PII/operational + owned children; **SET NULL** = money/ledger history + analytics + admin-actor refs (retain-anonymized erasure); **RESTRICT** = catalog reward + product-content (block accidental loss); **SKIP** = external/opaque + polymorphic + `competitive_insights.generated_by` (system/ai sentinel) + `audit_log.*` (decoupled).
- 5 `user_id` columns made nullable (`point_transactions`, `payout_requests`, `reward_redemptions`, `user_events`, `email_send_events`) so SET NULL can fire.
- Fixed `brand_alerts.rule_id` type (text→uuid; it references a uuid PK) via Step 1b in the route + schema.ts.
- **Rewrote `process-deletions` cron:** single `delete(users)` drives CASCADE + SET NULL; manual deletes reduced to email-keyed (feedback/survey_responses) + FK-less cache (icp_match_scores); audit_log retained. Closes the old admin-deleted-orphan gap. No users-referencing FK is RESTRICT → cron can't brick.
- **Pre-flight prod cleanup:** orphan scan found 13 sets (deleted-user remnants from the *old* cron gap) → anonymized SET-NULL tables, deleted CASCADE orphans child-first (community_posts + contribution_events), created a `demo` placeholder product for 6 seed surveys (66 responses preserved). Re-scan empty.
- Null-audit (tsc-driven): 2 guards — payouts denial-refund skips erased users; analytics batch skips null-user events.

## Pre-beta HARD GATES (must pass before launch)

1. **CRON E2E TEST.** Rewritten `process-deletions` is live but has NEVER run against a real deletion. Parked short-term — *acceptable because the 30-day grace period guarantees no erasure fires for 30 days after any request* (delete-account sets `deletionScheduledFor = now+30d`; cron only deletes when that's past), so there's always runway. MUST pass before beta: throwaway user with data → mark for deletion → run cron with expired grace → confirm CASCADE cleared PII + SET NULL anonymized money/analytics + audit_log survived.
2. **ADMIN 2FA RECOVERY + prod 2FA verification.** vishjoshi789 locked out (TOTP-only; no authenticator/recovery codes; DB has 10 hashed codes, unreadable). Plan: DB-level 2FA reset (clear `user_totp_secrets` + `user_recovery_codes` + `users.two_factor_enabled=false`) → re-enroll fresh authenticator + **SAVE** codes → verify the prod 2FA interlock end-to-end (`[2FA-DEBUG]` logs, `requires2FA` → `/auth/two-factor`). DB unreachable from local box (`:5432` firewalled) — use Neon console or a deploy-time script.

## Next work
**Phase 2** — B14 redemption rounding + B35 refund→campaign_payments (code-side: read services → plan → implement).

## Housekeeping
- **`ADMIN_API_KEY` rotation IN PROGRESS** — was `test123` (weak + exposed in chat); rotating to a strong value, Production scope, redeploy-bound.
- `[MW] enforce=` diagnostic removed (Phase 1 commit). `[MW]`/`[2FA-DEBUG]` still always-on — gate behind a debug flag eventually.
- `db-diag.mjs` **kept** (untracked; gitignore) — it's the scaffold for the 2FA DB reset above. Can't connect from local box (`:5432` firewalled), but usable from a network with DB egress.
